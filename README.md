- 👋 Hi, I’m @Obigham
- 👀 **I’m interested in People. On my first business card I listed myself as a person first.** 
- I think the world would be a lot more fun, kind and accessible if we treated each other in that regard. 
- **I love tools that allow us to connect.** As a cinematographer I used a camera and a computer now I understand
- the underlying technologies and am learning to use them thru web development, mobile app development, and more. 
- **I'm also interested in:** electric vehicles, and overall anything that can be classified as tools that better humanity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, 3D modeling in Cinema 4d.**
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I can continue to grow and test the foundations I have developed.
